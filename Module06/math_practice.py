Description: learning arithmetic operators in Python
'''

# Operator: +
# Meaning: adds two operands
# Example:
print ("1 + 2 =", 1 + 2)

# Operator: -
# Meaning: subtracts right operand from left
# Example:
print ("9 - 2 =", 9 - 2)


# Operator: *
# Meaning: multiplies two operands
# Example:
print ("8 * 2 =", 8 * 2)

# Operator: /
# Meaning: divides left operand by right one -- always results in a float in Python 3.x
# Example:
print("5 / 2 =", 5 / 2)
print("4 / 2 =", 4 / 2)

# Operator: % (modulus or mod)
# Meaning: divides left operand by right one and returns remainder
# Example:
print("10 % 2 =", 10 % 2) # 2 goes into 10 exactly 5 times, remainder is 0
print("11 % 2 =", 11 % 2) # 2 goes into 11 5 times, remainder is 1

# Operator: // (floor division)
# Meaning: division that results into whole number by rounding down
# Example:
print("2 // 5  =", 2 // 5) # 2 / 5 is 0.4 which rounds down to 0
print("5 // 2  =", 5 // 2) # 5 / 2 is 2.5 which rounds down to 2

# Operator: ** (exponent)
# Meaning: left operand raised to the power of the right
# Example:
print("2 ** 4 =", 2 ** 4)
